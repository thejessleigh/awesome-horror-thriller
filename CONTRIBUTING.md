## Issue Labels

Several issues have lables on them in this repo. There are generally two kinds of labels.

- `help wanted`

This label refers to an issue about the organization and sections of the list itself. There might be several ways to accomplish a task and the maintaners aren't exactly sure how to go about it. Anyone is welcome to comment on or self-assign this issue if they have a strong opinion about how to resolve the problem.

- `recommendation question`

We ask that contributors only recommend media that you have actually consumed and can speak to personally. If you would like to know whether *anyone else* would recommend a work, you can create an issue and add the `recommendation question` label.

If you see a `recommendation question` issue open and you would like to engage in a conversation about it, feel free to talk in the issue comments. If you would recommend it as a piece of awesome horror or thriller media, make a pull request and close the issue after it is merged!

## Adding an item to the list

All new items to the list should adhere to the following

- Only suggest items that you have consumed and can make a personal comment about. If you are curious about a particular piece of media, open an issue to see if anyone else recommends it.
- The entry should contain the title and creator links, publication year (or publication run for ongoing media), rating, description, and your personal commentary.
	- For books and short stories, the creator will be the author(s) of the book. For comics, please include the illustrator alongside the author. For movies, please include the director.
	- For books, comics, and short stories please copy the description and rating from [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) and link to the Goodreads entry.
	- For movies and TV shows, please copy the description and rating from [IMDb](https://imdb.com) and link to the IMDb entry.
	- Please link the creator's [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) page. If no such page exists, it should point to the creator's [Goodread's](https://goodreads.com) or [IMDb](https://imdb.com) page. If no such links exist, please leave the creator name in plain text instead of including a link.
- Use the following format:

```
#### [title](link) (year) *by [creator](link)* [rating]

Commentary - [@you](https://github.com/you)

> Description
```

- Please add the entry to the correct section in alphabetical order. If you are not sure which section a work belongs to, put it in the general Horror/Thriller section.
- Please add your name and the link to your github next to your commentary. Pull requests without a personal comment will not be merged.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Please check the list to make sure you do not submit a duplicate item. (However, feel free to add your personal comments to existing items.)
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Please be as descriptive as possible with pull request titles and commit messages.
- Categories are encouraged but not required. Categories should use inline code ticks and be whitespace delimited.

```
Categories: `gothic horror` `psychological thriller` `camp`
```
- Please make sure you eliminate trailing whitespace before submitting a pull request.

### Short Stories

Please recommend individual stories, not collected works. This list is a curation, not a comprehensive collection. We only want to showcase the most awesome stories in the genre. However, feel free to submit multiple stories from the same collection!

Many short stories have their own individual [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) page. Please link to that when possible. If there is no [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) entry available for an individual short story entry, please provide a [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) link to first publication in which the story appears.

### Podcasts

For podcasts, please link to the iTunes page for the podcast. For the creator, list the podcast host or podcast presentation company as listed on iTunes and link to their wikipedia page. Copy and paste the description from iTunes as the podcast description.

If there is no wikipedia page for the podcast creator, link to the person or podcast collective's webiste.

### Video Games

For video games, please link to the Wikipedia page for the game. For the creator, list the studio that released the game and link to their Wikipedia page as well.

If the game does not have a Wikipedia page, link to the home page for that game.

If the game was created by a solo developer and they do not have a Wiki page, list their name and link to their portfolio website.

### Thank you for adding a new suggestion!
