## Novels

#### [Bird Box](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22350224-bird-box) (2014) *by [Josh Malerman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Malerman)* [3.98]

Categories: `horror` `post-apocalyptic` `psychological`

This is a book I read in one sitting, and stayed up late in order to do so. This is a thrilling novel that toys with the reader's senses. For a large part of the story, the characters cannot see, and there is little to no visual description. Rather, it relies on the other four senses to push the story forward. This is one of the most tense and addictive stories I've ever read. I wish I could experience it again for the first time. - [@sunrein](https://github.com/sunrein)

> Written with the narrative tension of The Road and the exquisite terror of classic Stephen King, Bird Box is a propulsive, edge-of-your-seat horror thriller, set in an apocalyptic near-future worldâ€”a masterpiece of suspense from the brilliantly imaginative Josh Malerman.

> Something is out there . . .

> Something terrifying that must not be seen. One glimpse and a person is driven to deadly violence. No one knows what it is or where it came from.

> Five years after it began, a handful of scattered survivors remain, including Malorie and her two young children. Living in an abandoned house near the river, she has dreamed of fleeing to a place where they might be safe. Now, that the boy and girl are four, it is time to go. But the journey ahead will be terrifying: twenty miles downriver in a rowboatâ€”blindfoldedâ€”with nothing to rely on but her wits and the childrenâ€™s trained ears. One wrong choice and they will die. And something is following them. But is it man, animal, or monster?

> Engulfed in darkness, surrounded by sounds both familiar and frightening, Malorie embarks on a harrowing odysseyâ€”a trip that takes her into an unseen world and back into the past, to the companions who once saved her. Under the guidance of the stalwart Tom, a motely group of strangers banded together against the unseen terror, creating order from the chaos. But when supplies ran low, they were forced to venture outsideâ€”and confront the ultimate question: in a world gone mad, who can really be trusted?

> Interweaving past and present, Josh Malermanâ€™s breathtaking debut is a horrific and gripping snapshot of a world unraveled that will have you racing to the final page.

#### [Dracula](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34810834-dracula) (1897) *by [Bram Stoker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker)* [3.97] ðŸŒŸðŸ”¥

Categories: `gothic` `horror` `vampire`

No list of great horror works would be complete without *Dracula*. This is a stunning example of epistolary novels done right, gothic horror done right, and defined an entire genre unto itself. If you are only familiar with Dracula through film or general pop culture references, I can't recommend the source material enough. I knew the basic story beats well before I ever picked the book up, and it still managed to suck me in. If audiobooks are your thing, definintely dry out the Audible full cast recording. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> When Jonathan Harker visits Transylvania to help Count Dracula with the purchase of a London house, he makes horrifying discoveries about his client and his castle. Soon afterwards, a number of disturbing incidents unfold in England: an unmanned ship is wrecked at Whitby; strange puncture marks appear on a young womanâ€™s neck; and the inmate of a lunatic asylum raves about the imminent arrival of his â€˜Masterâ€™. In the ensuing battle of wits between the sinister Count Dracula and a determined group of adversaries, Bram Stoker created a masterpiece of the horror genre, probing deeply into questions of human identity and sanity, and illuminating dark corners of Victorian sexuality and desire.

#### [The Haunting of Hill House](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89717.The_Haunting_of_Hill_House) (1959) *by [Shirley Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Jackson)* [3.89] ðŸŒŸ

Categories: `gothic` `horror` `haunted house`

A classic of the genre, The Haunting of Hill House is a must read for anyone looking to build their horror repitorie. Calling this deeply psychological and discordant novel a haunted house story simply does it a disservice. It helped establish so many tropes of the genre, yet feels timeless. I find something new every time I read it. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> First published in 1959, Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House has been hailed as a perfect work of unnerving terror. It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of a "haunting"; Theodora, his lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powersâ€”and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.

#### [House of Leaves](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24800.House_of_Leaves) (2000) *by [Mark Z. Danielewski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Z._Danielewski)* [4.13]

Categories: `horror` `nested narratives`

I first read this book when I was far too young for it to have been appropriate and it did a lot to shape my aesthetic. This beautiful, weird meta-textual novel makes you work, but it sticks with you. This book will fill your dreams with endless hallways and broken promises. An absolute must read. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> A blind old man, a young apprentice working in a tattoo shop, and a mad woman haunting an Ohio institute narrate this story of a family that encounters an endlessly shifting series of hallways in their new home, eventually coming face to face with the awful darkness lying at its heart.

#### [John Dies at the End](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1857440.John_Dies_at_the_End) (2007) *by [David Wong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wong_(writer))* [3.92]

Categories: `horror` `humor`

I remember reading this back when it was available online before it was picked up by a publisher. It's ridiculous and juvenile, but it's also compelling and genuinely frightening at times. Definitely worth picking up if you're in the mood for some camp mixed in with your horror. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> **STOP.** You should not have touched this flyer with your bare hands. NO, don't put it down. It's too late. They're watching you. **My name is David Wong**. My best friend is John. Those names are fake. You might want to change yours. You may not want to know about the things you'll read on these pages, about **the sauce**, about **Korrok**, about the invasion, and the future. But it's too late. You touched the book. You're in the game. You're under **the eye**. The only defense is knowledge. You need to read this book, to the end. Even the part with the bratwurst. Why? You just have to trust me.

> **The important thing is this**: The drug is called **Soy Sauce** and it gives users a window into another dimension. John and I never had the chance to say no. You still do. I'm sorry to have involved you in this, I really am. But as you read about these terrible events and the very **dark epoch** the world is about to enter as a result, it is crucial you keep one thing in mind: *None of this was my fault*.

#### [Swan Song](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11557.Swan_Song) (1987) *by [Robert McCammon](http://www.robertmccammon.com/)* [4.28]

Categories: `horror`

Many post-apocalyptic fiction tropes, plus a character that I'm pretty sure was meant to be a deconstruction of Ender's Game. Robert McCammon has a vivid style that has made him one of my favorite writers. - [@duganchen](https://github.com/duganchen)

> In a wasteland born of rage and fear, populated by monstrous creatures and marauding armies, earth's last survivors have been drawn into the final battle between good and evil, that will decide the fate of humanity: Sister, who discovers a strange and transformative glass artifact in the destroyed Manhattan streets; Joshua Hutchins, the pro wrestler who takes refuge from the nuclear fallout at a Nebraska gas station; and Swan, a young girl possessing special powers, who travels alongside Josh to a Missouri town where healing and recovery can begin with Swan's gifts. But the ancient force behind earth's devastation is scouring the walking wounded for recruits for its relentless army, beginning with Swan herself.

#### [Kane](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22524133-kane) (1990) *by [Michael Prescott](http://michaelprescott.freeservers.com/)* [3.65]

Categories: `horror`

The old paperback edition, published under the name "Douglas Borton", is one of the books that got me into reading! How's that for a recommendation? Anyway, this is one of those stories set in isolated small towns, with lots of 80s horror movie influences and an initially large cast. A DRM-free edition is available from Smashwords. - [@duganchen](https://github.com/duganchen)

> From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Michael Prescott, author of FINAL SINS and SHATTER, comes a relentless and
explosive thriller.

> The people of Tuskett, California, sense something wrong with the man who comes striding out of the Mojave, the man with icy blue eyes.  Something unnatural, like a prayer recited backward or a cross hung upside down.

> Something evil.

> Then darkness falls, draping the sleepy desert town like a burial shroud, and in the night shadows the man called Kane goes to work.

> And his work is death ...

> A motion picture adaptation of KANE is currently in development with Canadian production company Unstable Ground.

#### [Weaveworld](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52640.Weaveworld) (2001) *by [Clive Barker](http://www.clivebarker.info/)* [4.13]

Categories: `horror` `fantasy` `dark fantasy`

Unmistakably Clive Barker's best work. Take everything that was great about his short fiction&mdash;the sensuality, the imagination&mdash;and give it the plot of a bestseller. His later books mostly explored the same ideas and themes as this novel and his earlier shorter-form works: just at a slower pace. - [@duganchen](https://github.com/duganchen)

> Clive Barker has made his mark on modern fiction by exposing all that is surreal and magical in the ordinary world --- and exploring the
profound and overwhelming terror that results. With its volatile mix of the fantastical and the contemporary, the everyday and the
otherworldly, Weaveworld is an epic work of dark fantasy and horror -- a tour de force from one of today's most forceful and imaginative
artists.

> Barker turns from his usual horror to epic-length fantasy for this account of the Fugue, a magical land inhabited by descendants of
supernatural beings who once shared the earth with humans. The Fugue has been woven into a carpet for protection against those who would
destroy it; the death of its guardian occasions a battle between good and particularly repulsive evil forces for control of the Fugue.
Weaveworld is rich with memorable characters, exciting situations, and pockets of Barker's trademark horror.

## Short Stories

#### [The Cask of Amontillado](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/261240.The_Cask_of_Amontillado) (1846) *by [Edgar Allen Poe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe)* [4.09] ðŸŒŸ

Categories: `horror` `live burial`

Although *The Telltale Heart* is maybe Poe's more notorious piece of short horror fiction, I find *The Cask of Amontillado* to be more horrifying and enduring. It's a tale of petty grievances and severe consequences that rings true to real life cruelty. [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> "The Cask of Amontillado" (sometimes spelled "The Casque of Amontillado") is a short story, written by Edgar Allan Poe and first published in the November 1846 issue of Godey's Lady's Book.

> The story is set in a nameless Italian city in an unspecified year (possibly sometime during the eighteenth century) and concerns the deadly revenge taken by the narrator on a friend who he claims has insulted him. Like several of Poe's stories, and in keeping with the 19th-century fascination with the subject, the narrative revolves around a person being buried alive â€“ in this case, by immurement.

#### [The Lottery](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6219656-the-lottery) (1948) *by [Shirley Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Jackson)* [4.09] ðŸŒŸ

Categories: `horror` `mob mentality`

I first read this when I was eight or nine and my mom was trying to introduce me to the magic of short fiction one summer break. I don't know what to say about this other than it's a classic and it's stayed with me and haunted me ever since I first read it. [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery" is a memorable and terrifying masterpiece, fueled by a tension that creeps up on you slowly without any clear indication of why. This is just a townful of people, after all, choosing their numbers for the annual lottery. What's there to be scared of?

#### [The Willows](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11438) (1907) *by [Algernon Blackwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algernon_Blackwood)*

Categories: `early horror` `horror` `isolation` `supernatural` `weird fiction`

The Willows is a perfect example of my favorite sort of story. It features creeping, unsettling horror that culminates in strange and mostly unexplained events. The imagery from this one has stuck with me since I first read it. - [@margarethogg](https://github.com/margarethogg)

> Two friends are midway through a canoe trip down theÂ DanubeÂ River, when flood waters carry them into an uninhabited area. They are forced to stop overnight on one of the many small, sandy islands dotting the river, and on setting up camp are almost immediately confronted by odd sights that serve to set the tone for their stay.

## Movies

#### [The Abandoned](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475937/?ref_=nv_sr_1) (2006) *by [Nacho CerdÃ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacho_Cerd%C3%A0)* [5.6]

Categories: `horror` `supernatural` `psychological thriller`

Mostly a ghost story, with a little bit of zombie and sci-fi trope in there. The Abandoned is tightly plotted, wonderfully acted, and visually stunning. Definitely worth a watch and a re-watch.  - [@margarethogg](https://github.com/margarethogg)

> An adopted woman returns to her home country and the family home that she never knew and must face the mystery that lies there.

#### [Get Out](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/) (2017) *by [Jordan Peele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peele)* [7.8]

Categories: `horror`

The first time I saw this movie I immediately wanted to turn around and see it again. I've never seen a movie where the quality of the performances changes so drastically between the first and second viewings. I won't spoil anything here, but I thought I knew what was going on the first time I watched this. I didn't. I'm not often so caught off guard, horrified, and sickened by a film at the same time. In my opinion, this is a modern masterpiece. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> It's time for a young African American to meet with his white girlfriend's parents for a weekend in their secluded estate in the woods, but before long, the friendly and polite ambience will give way to a nightmare.

#### [Marnie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058329) (1964) *by [Alfred Hitchcock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock)* [7.2] ðŸŒŸ

Categories: `crime` `drama` `thriller` `romance`

One of Hitchcock's underrated films, in my opinion. Tippi Hedren plays Marnie, a deeply manipulative and damaged woman who professionally takes advantage of men. Marnie is found out by Mark, played by Sean Connery, who blackmails her into marrying him. The gender politics are, of course, dated by today's standards. But the sense of danger is built up so masterfully, and Hedren and Connery have such an amazing on screen chemistry. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> Mark marries Marnie although she is a habitual thief and has serious psychological problems, and tries to help her confront and resolve them.

#### [Rosemary's Baby](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063522/) (1968) *by [Roman Polanski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski)* [8.0] ðŸŒŸ

Categories: `drama` `horror` `psychological` `supernatural`

*Rosemary's Baby* creates an atmosphere of doubt, unease, and wrongness from the first few frames that only grows as the movie progresses. It's suffocating and monstrous. Possibly one of the best scary movies of all time. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> A young couple move into an apartment, only to be surrounded by peculiar neighbors and occurrences. When the wife becomes mysteriously pregnant, paranoia over the safety of her unborn child begins to control her life.

#### [The Silence of the Lambs](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102926/) (1991) *by [Jonathan Demme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Demme)* [8.6] ðŸŒŸðŸ”¥

Categories: `crime` `drama` `psychological thriller`

Although the gender politics of Buffalo Bill are outdated and problematic, Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster's performances are timeless and elevated *The Silence of the Lambs* to an instant classic. The pacing is slow, deliberate, and methodical in a way that is often immitated but seldom perfected in thrillers. Foster's performance is so tight and so skilled that this movie is watching just for the work she does alone. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> A young F.B.I. cadet must confide in an incarcerated and manipulative killer to receive his help on catching another serial killer who skins his victims.

#### [The Witch](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4263482/) (2015) *by [Robert Eggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Eggers)* [6.8]

Categories: `drama` `historical` `horror` `period peice` `social isolation` `witches`

*The Witch* proved controversial after its initial release in 2015. It was publicly endorsed by The Satanic Temple, which is how many people, myself included, first heard about it. It was critically well reviewed, but the general audience reception on Rotten Tomatoes and elsewhere was tepid. This is somewhat understandable as *The Witch* can be difficult to watch at times. Much of the dialogue is pulled from period primary source documents and the pacing is grueling and methodical. It's as much about the horror of social isolation and religious fanaticism as it is any supernatural elements the film might contain. It's not a conventional horror film, but it is truly horrifying and engaging. There is some amazing and subtle acting that stuck with me for months after I saw the film in its initial theatrical release. *The Witch* is certainly not for everyone, but if you appreciate thoughtful and meticulously paced meditations on isolation, paranoia, scapegoating, and social taboo, you *must* give this a shot. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.

## Television

#### [Hannibal](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2243973) (2013-2015) *by [Bryan Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Fuller)* [8.6]

Categories: `crime` `drama` `psychological thriller`

Hannibal is something of a tone poem. The character development and relationships at the core of the show are the stars here. The show manages to keep you engaged and terrified despite knowing from popular culture where Hannibal Lecter ends up. Plus, the food cinematography is amazing and disturbing. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> Explores the early relationship between the renowned psychiatrist and his patient, a young FBI criminal profiler, who is haunted by his ability to empathize with serial killers.

#### [Penny Dreadful](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2628232/) (2014-2016) *by [John Logan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Logan_(writer))* [8.2]

Categories: `drama` `gothic` `horror`

I feel like it's trendy nowadays to inject a fair bit of camp and winking at the camera when taking on a serious horror piece. Many pieces that don't often fall into a dreary self-seriousness that becomes unintentionally funny. *Penny Dreadful* manages to avoid both, taking itself and its ideas seriously without becoming a dour slog. And most importantly, it manages to take well worn tropes and deliver scenes that are actually horrifying without resorting to petty jump scares or gore for the sake of gore. I personally think the first season is the tighest. It follows an adaptation of the Dracula storyline that will be familiar to fans of the novel, but finds ways to keep it fresh and unpredictable. The series also has the good sense to end before it loses its magic. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> Explorer Sir Malcolm Murray, American gunslinger Ethan Chandler, scientist Victor Frankenstein and medium Vanessa Ives unite to combat supernatural threats in Victorian London.

#### [Puella Magi Madoka Magica](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1773185/) (2011) *by [Akiyuki Shinbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiyuki_Shinbo)* [8.4]

Categories: `anime` `drama` `horror` `magical girl`

Madoka Magica is a brilliant deconstruction of the magical girl anime trope. The art direction is like nothing I've ever seen before and is worth watching just for the battle scenes alone. A definite must for horror and anime fans everywhere. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> A creature named Kyubey offers to grant Madoka a wish if she becomes a 'magical girl' and fights grotesque witches. A magical girl named Homura tries to stop this agreement, and the true nature of the contract with Kyubey is revealed.

#### [Stranger Things](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/) (2016 - Present) *by [The Duffer Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffer_Brothers)* [8.9]

Categories: `horror` `fantasy` `small town`

As with most horror, the central moster is more interesting the less they show of it. The pacing and deliberate doling out of information is very well done, and while I'm not usually a fan of child actors, this cast is fantastic. I was resistant to trying this one for a long time due to the hype, but it really is great. I'm glad I watched it in time to catch the Season 2 drop along with all the other fans. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> When a young boy disappears, his mother, a police chief, and his friends must confront terrifying forces in order to get him back.

## Comic Books

#### [Delphine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14475472-delphine) (2013) *by [Richard Sala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Sala)* [3.2]

Categories: `horror` `fairy tale`

This fairy tale reimagining is beautifully illustrated. The plot itself is somewhat standard fare, but the illustrations give the concept new life. Sala draws grainy and gnarled faces and scenery that are absolutely stunning. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejesseleigh)

> A mysterious traveler gets off the train in a small village surrounded by a thick, sinister forest. He is searching for Delphine, who vanished with only a scrawled-out address on a scrap of paper as a trace. In his newest chiller, Richard Sala takes the tale of Snow White and stands it on its head, retelling it from Prince Charming's perspective (the unnamed traveler) in a contemporary setting. This twisted tale includes all the elements of terror from the original fairy tale, with none of the insipid saccharine coating of the Disney animated adaptation. Yes, there will be blood.

> Originally serialized as part of the acclaimed international series, Delphine is executed in a rich and ominous duotone that shows off Sala's virtuosity just as much as last year's full-color post-apocalyptic horror fantasy The Hidden did; punctuated with stunning full-color chapter breaks.

#### [Fatale](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13580807-fatale-vol-1) (2012 - 2014) *by [Ed Brubaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Brubaker), illustrated by [Sean Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Phillips)* [3.91]

Categories: `crime` `horror` `lovecraftian` `noir`

I really liked the intersection of horror and noir in this limited run series. I'm also really glad it was a limited run because I think it was perfect as a contained story, and not an ongoing saga. I think, generally, the series starts stronger than it ends, but it's still pretty awesome and definitely worth the read. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> Secrets, lies, horror, lust and monsters from the time before time all collide in Fatale, Book One: Death Chases Me.

> In present day, a man meets a woman who he becomes instantly obsessed with, and in the 1950s, this same woman destroys the lives of all those who cross her path, on a quest for... what?

#### [Through the Woods](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18659623-through-the-woods) (2014) *by [Emily Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Carroll)* [3.92]

Categories: `horror` `fairy tale`

Emily Carroll does amazing things with color to create a sense of disquiet from the very beginning. I loved the way that she played with sound and movement in some of her panel-less pages. Her stories have a fairy tale quality to them, so each one feels both familiar and new at the same time. This is a beautiful collection full of eerie and unsettling stories. Great for anyone who misses what it feels like to the Grimm's fairy tales for the first time. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> Five mysterious, spine-tingling stories follow journeys into (and out of?) the eerie abyss.
These chilling tales spring from the macabre imagination of acclaimed and award-winning comic creator Emily Carroll.

#### [Wytches](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25243735-wytches-volume-1)  (2015) *by [Scott Snyder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Snyder), illustrated by [Jock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jock_(cartoonist))* [3.84]

The art and character design in this is amazing, and I loved the relationship between Sailor and her dad. I thought it was really well done. While the discussion of normalizing and dealing with anxiety and mental illness was a bit generic, it served the father-daughter relationship well. Definitely a good one-sitting read with creepy art and a very unique take on witches. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> Everything you thought you knew about witches is wrong. They are much darker, and they are much more horrifying. Wytches takes the mythology of witches to a far creepier, bone-chilling place than readers have dared venture before. When the Rooks family moves to the remote town of Litchfield, NH to escape a haunting trauma, they're hopeful about starting over. But something evil is waiting for them in the woods just beyond town. Watching from the trees. Ancient...and hungry.

At first glance, RPG maker seems like a weird choice for a game about an art gallery. However, once you start playing the constraints of using sprites on the game artwork really inspired some creative and creepy visuals. The toy box part of the game is some of the most innovative map building I've ever seen. If you like single player RPG maker style games, this is an aboslute must play. - [@thejessleigh](https://github.com/thejessleigh)

> Ib (ã‚¤ãƒ´ Ivu) is a free-to-play adventure video game released in 2012 by the Japanese artist kouri. In the game, the player controls a character from a top-down perspective, exploring an eldritch art museum with the intent to escape, solving puzzles to advance. Despite the limitations of its engine, it effectively employs elements of psychological horror.
